# luna - tech tasks

If you are reading this then you have successfully found our git repo and are ready to take on our technical tasks!

All tasks are based around the fictional **luna** web app, which is a rudimentary React application built with Create React App and TypeScript that you will run on your local machine. The app is very crude and uses a local JSON file as it's data source - but please approach each task as you would in your normal working life if contributing to a production grade application.

Each task has a "YOUR COMMENTS HERE" section that we encourage you to leave some comments in relevant to the task you have just completed.

If you struggle with a particular task, or feel the instructions are not clear - that's not a problem. Just do the best you can and leave a note in the comments area for that task.

## Prerequisite - get the app up and running

Install the required dependencies and then run the app as a local dev build with:

```
npm start
```

## Task 1 - Product Tweaks üîß

The following feedback has come in from the product owner, can you apply these updates?

- Sort the Category filter buttons alphabetically
- Add a "count" display to the Category filter buttons showing how many articles exist within each category
- Add a mechanism for users to clear any selected Category filter
- Ensure that all of the "View" button CTAs on the article grid are aligned with the equivalent buttons in the same row

```
For your information, while installing the dependencies, there were multiple warnings about deprecations but I ignored them to not break something accidentally and affect how I complete the tasks. I am sorry if that was intended!

To sort the Category filter button alphabetically, I  used the sort() and .localeCompare() methods. The method allows us to sort strings alphabetically, and it is case-insensitive. 

For the "count" display, I created a utility function. I added the relevant types to interfaces, such as adding the 'Article' type to the ICategorySelector interface, I then ensured that all the required modules were imported and exported for it to work.

My mechanism to clear filters is pretty easy, if clicked to the selected button again, it clears your selection!

Lastly, I aligned the "View" buttons by adding the align items: last baseline CSS property to the ArticleGrid class. This causes some cells to appear taller but I think the UI still looks good. I also added a margin-top property to add separation between the ArticleGrid and CategorySelector divs.
```

## Task 2 - Test Coverage ü§ì

The app currently has a test coverage of around `70%` which can be checked by running:

```
npm run test:coverage
```

Can you add extend the `App.test.tsx` file to get our overall coverage to in excess of `85%`?

```
I increased the coverage to 97.5%. I divided the tests to describe blocks. I also wrote unit tests for my utility function. I used test data to test the function in case the original data alters in the future and to test an edge case.
```

## Task 3 - Article List Content üìú

The `ArticleDisplay` component isn't quite complete as it is not able to render any lists that appear in the article content (i.e. if you view the "Explaining eye bags" article you should see two red blocks stating "LIST CONTENT NEEDS TO APPEAR HERE")

Can you finish off the implementation by ensuring that list content is displayed in articles appropriately. Feel free to overhaul the existing implementation as you see fit

```
I finished off this task by completing the existing logic. However, it is worth noting that in types.ts line 13, the ListContent type was assigned to Paragraph OR ParagraphContent - I changed this to assign it only to the Paragraph type, because the ParagraphContent type is not applicable to the "bullet-list" or "ordered-list" type of objects.
```

## Task 4 - Shared Components üë™

The product owner has asked that the main CTAs in the app (i.e. the "View" and "Close" buttons on the `ArticleGrid` and `ArticleDisplay` components) have their text displayed in uppercase. As an optimisation while making this change can you refactor those two components to use a common `Button` component (so that when the product owner decides to revert this change we only have to do it in one place ü§≠)

## Task 5 - Mobile Responsiveness üì±

We have had some feedback that the web app isn't working particularly well for users on mobile devices when viewing articles. Can you upgrade our ArticleDisplay component to be more mobile friendly while not impacting the current desktop experience?

## Task 6 - Accessibility üëì

An independent accessibility audit has highlighted some issues with our app. Can you explain what accessibility means in this context and implement some accessibility related enhancements to our app?

## Task 7 - New Search Feature üîé

It's time to roll you out your very first feature! The brief is short and there are no designs for us to use as it needs to be shipped tomorrow! üò¨

The brief: Users need to be able to search across all of our articles via text

## Bonus Task - Make the app "Pop" ‚ù§Ô∏è

As our newest team member, seeing the (albeit rudimentary) **luna** web app with fresh eyes for the first time is a moment that we like to capitalise on! Can you comment on the UX of our web app, and implement some changes that you think would **delight and surprise** our users.
